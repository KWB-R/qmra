QMRA is a Django project which experiments with deploying state of the art techniques 
for Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). 

The implemented simulations rely on a freely available `database <https://kwb-r.github.io/qmra.db/>`_, which was developed within the research project `Aquanes <https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/689450>`_.

The tool allows to estimate the risk of infection for three reference pathogen (Rotavirus, *Campylobacer jejuni*, and *Cryptosporidium parvum*) for mutliple source waters and treatment scenarios.
