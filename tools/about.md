## About this site

This website is developed as a personal project to experiment with deploying state-of-the art methods for [quantitative microbial risk assessement (QMRA)](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/qmra/en/) for water supply and water reuse systems as a web-based tool.

The implemented simulations rely on a freely available [database](https://kwb-r.github.io/qmra.db/), which was developed at the [Berlin Center for Competence for Water](https://kompetenz-wasser.de) in collaboration with [KWR](https://www.kwrwater.nl/en/) within the research project [Aquanes](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/689450).

The tool allows to estimate the risk of infection for three reference pathogen (rotavirus, *Campylobacer jejuni*, and *Cryptosporidium parvum*) for mutliple source waters and treatment scenarios.

Users are also able to create and manage their own treatments and customize the tools to their specific needs. User are also able to upload their local data to estimate site specific log-removal and pathogen concentrations. If preferred, the software can also be download and run locally.
